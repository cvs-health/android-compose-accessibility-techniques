# android-compose-accessibility-techniques

Demonstrates a variety of accessibility best practices for Android Jetpack Compose-based UIs, as well as the problems they can address.
Using the app will demonstrate the impact of accessibility best practices, and reviewing the app project source code will help you learn how to apply those techniques in working code.

See [android-compose-accessibility-techniques Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) for details of the app architecture and the project's file structure.

Since some of the code demonstrates the effect of inaccessible coding practices, the app itself does not fully conform to required accessibility guidelines.
