# Autofill Controls
Whenever possible, supply previously entered data values to text input fields to reduce redundant data entry. This is done in support of the WCAG [Success Criterion 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#identify-input-purpose) and [Success Criterion 3.3.7 Redundant Entry](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#redundant-entry).

Two approaches to auto-filling input field values are to connect `TextField` data to an Autofill Service and to supply known application data.

## Connect `TextField` data to an Autofill Service

Text input fields can be autofilled by connecting their underlying state data to an `AutofillNode`, and requesting that autofill information be populated when the fields each receive focus. By doing so, any installed Autofill Service can provide suggested data values to those fields. 

* See [Autofill Overview](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/autofill/package-summary) (especially [AutofillType](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/autofill/AutofillType)) and the [ExplicitAutofillTypesDemo.kt](https://cs.android.com/androidx/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main:compose/ui/ui/integration-tests/ui-demos/src/main/java/androidx/compose/ui/demos/autofill/ExplicitAutofillTypesDemo.kt) sample code for details. 
    * Also, read the View UI framework document [Optimize your app for autofill](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/text/autofill-optimize) for background on the Android autofill framework and Autofill Services.
* This approach, and supplying [Keyboard Types](../interactions/KeyboardTypes.md), are necessary to fulfill WCAG [Success Criterion 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#identify-input-purpose) on Android.

For example:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun AutofilledEmailTextField(
    email: String,
    setEmail: (String) -> Unit
) {
    // Technique: Create an AutofillNode with AutofillType(s) and state setter lambda. Connect it to 
    // the LocalAutofillTree.  
    val autofillNode = AutofillNode(listOf(AutofillType.EmailAddress), onFill = setEmail)
    LocalAutofillTree.current += autofillNode
    
    // Define access to LocalAutofill for later use in a non-composable context.
    val localAutofill = LocalAutofill.current

    OutlinedTextField(
        value = email,
        onValueChange = setEmail,
        modifier = Modifier
            // ... handle keyboard trap, etc. ...
            .onFocusChanged { focusState ->
                // Technique: on focus change, request autofill data or cancel existing request.
                localAutofill?.run {
                    if (focusState.isFocused) {
                        requestAutofillForNode(autofillNode)
                    } else {
                        cancelAutofillForNode(autofillNode)
                    }
                }
            }
            // Technique: Set the autofillNode bounding box for pop-up positioning.
            .onGloballyPositioned { autofillNode.boundingBox = it.boundsInWindow() },
        // Always label TextFields...
        label = { Text("Email")},
        // Use KeyboardType.Email to enter email addresses.
        keyboardOptions = KeyboardOptions.Default.copy(
            keyboardType = KeyboardType.Email,
            imeAction = ImeAction.Next
        ),
        // ... other TextField properties ...
    )
}
```

## Supply known application data

Input fields can also be auto-populated by supplying default data values from known application data. For example, shipping address fields can be filled from previously-entered billing address data, which will simplify data entry when the billing and shipping addresses are the same.

(Note: The hard-coded text shown in these examples is only used for simplicity. _Always_ use externalized string resource references in actual code.)
