# Heading Semantics
Top-level heading text must be marked as an accessibility heading. This supports the WCAG [Success Criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#info-and-relationships), which requires information conveyed through presentation (such as larger-sized heading text) to be programmatically available to accessibility services.

Mark a composable as an accessibility heading by applying `Modifier.semantics { heading() }`. 

For example:

```
Text("This is a heading",
    style = MaterialTheme.typography.headlineSmall,
    modifier = modifier
        .fillMaxWidth()
        .semantics { heading() }
)
```

Notes:

* One complication of heading semantics on Android is that list items in the standard lazy list composables (such as `LazyColumn`) can not fully acts as accessibility headings. List items marked with `heading()` should announce as headings, but heading navigation may or may not work in a lazy list. Logically, this makes a certain sense since not all of the list items are initially known.
* Never use `android:contentDescription` to append an accessibility property like "Heading" to a `View`. It may sound almost correct in TalkBack, but doesn't work correctly.
* Native Android apps do not have multiple heading levels. Only mark top-level headings as a heading.
* The hard-coded text shown in these examples is only used for simplicity. _Always_ use externalized string resource references in actual code.
