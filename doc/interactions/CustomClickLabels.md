# Custom Click Labels
By default, "clickable" composables announce their click action in TalkBack as "Double-tap to activate." This announcement can be partially customized to improve the user experience; for example, to say "Double-tap to show details" or "Double-tap to sign in." 

Notes: 

* Assigning a custom action label does not change TalkBack's standard click action description "Double-tap to ...", only what is said after that point.
* Custom click action labels can also affect how Switch Access displays a selected control when multiple actions are available on that control.

## `Modifier.clickable()`'s `onClickLabel` parameter

Most composables can accept a customized click action label when they are made clickable by `Modifier.clickable()`. Just set that function's `onClickLabel` parameter with the custom label text.

For example:

```kotlin
Card(
    modifier = Modifier
        // Technique: Provide a custom onClickLabel to Modifier.clickable().
        .clickable(
            onClickLabel = "see details"
        ) {
            // ...
        }
) {
    // ...
}
```

# Buttons and `Modifier.semantics`' `onClick()` property's `label` parameter

Unfortunately, Material Design `Button`s, `IconButton`s, and `Surface` take an `onClick` handler, but do not support a corresponding `onClickLabel` parameter. 

Fortunately, it is possible to customize their click action labels by applying `Modifier.semantics` with an `onClick()` property and setting its `label` parameter.

For example:

```kotlin
val clickAction = { 
    // do something...
}
Button(
    onClick = clickAction, // Activated by touchscreen and keyboard.
    modifier = Modifier.semantics {
        onClick(
            label = "show details"
        ) {
            // Activated by assistive technologies.
            // Always do the same thing onClick does.
            clickAction.invoke() 
            // And must return if that operation was successfully applied, if known.
            true
        }
    }
) {
    // Button label content...
}
```

Do not use `Modifier.clickable()` to add a custom click action label to a button or clickable `Surface`, as it will affect that composable's keyboard accessibility.

## Custom long-click labels

Composables can also be made long-clickable and given a customized long-click action label. 

For most composables, a custom long-click action and its custom label are set using `Modifier.combinedClickable()`'s `onLongClickLabel` property.

For `Button` composables, the long-click action and its custom label can be set with `Modifier.semantics` `onLongClick()` property.

(Note: The hard-coded text shown in these examples is only used for simplicity. _Always_ use externalized string resource references in actual code.)
